# DataStructures

## AVL Tree

Will be added soon.

## Binary Search Tree

[bst.cpp](https://github.com/Electron1997/DataStructures/blob/main/bst.cpp) contains an unbalanced BST implementation with recursive insert, delete and look-up operations. The code is actually a solution to https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/en/problems/view/1201.

### Insertion

### Deletion

### Lookup

## Disjoint Set Union

[dsu.cpp](https://github.com/Electron1997/DataStructures/blob/main/dsu.cpp) contains a DSU implementation with efficient union and find operations. The code is actually a solution to https://www.spoj.com/problems/ADABRANC.

### Union

### Find

## Segment Tree

[segtree.cpp](https://github.com/Electron1997/DataStructures/blob/main/segtree.cpp) contains an array-based segment tree implementation with iterative range and update operations. The code is actually a solution to https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2/lesson/4/1/practice/contest/273169/problem/A.

### Range

### Update

## Skip List

[skiplist.cpp](https://github.com/Electron1997/DataStructures/blob/main/skiplist.cpp) contains the implementation of a skip list with (in expectation) logarithmic insert, delete, look-up and indexing operations. The code is actually a solution to https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/searching/binary-search/practice-problems/algorithm/smallest-subarray-2-d6530e0b/.

### Insertion

### Deletion

### Lookup

### Indexing

## Splay Tree

Will be added soon.

## Treap

Will be added soon.

## Trie

[trie.cpp](https://github.com/Electron1997/DataStructures/blob/main/trie.cpp) contains an array-based trie implementation with insert and look-up operations. The code is actually a solution to https://www.spoj.com/problems/ADAINDEX.
