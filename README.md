# DataStructures

## BST
[bst.cpp](https://github.com/Electron1997/DataStructures/blob/main/bst.cpp) contains an unbalanced BST implementation with recursive insert, delete and look-up operations. The code is actually a solution to https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/en/problems/view/1201.

## Skip List
[skiplist.cpp](https://github.com/Electron1997/DataStructures/blob/main/skiplist.cpp) contains the implementation of a skip list with (in expectation) logarithmic insert, delete, look-up and indexing operations. The code is actually a solution to https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/searching/binary-search/practice-problems/algorithm/smallest-subarray-2-d6530e0b/.
